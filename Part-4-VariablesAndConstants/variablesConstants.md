# Define variable 
# $var_name = value;
# Using $var_name,we can change variable values as well.
# Rules of naming variables 
# 1)All variables should be of $ sign
# 2)After $,we cannot use number or special characters.We should only use alphabets.
# 3) We cannot use any special characters apart from underscore(_)
# 4) There should be no space in naming of variables.We should use _ to separate two names 
# 5) Variable names are case sensitive
# 6)$var_name is different from $VAR_NAME
# 7)No need to initialise variable with default values.
# 8)You can assign integer to string and string to integer values

# Single quotes vs Double quotes
# Single quotes considered everything as text while in double quotes,it checks for variable as well 

# Functions 
# If functions are defined after declaration or before declaration,it doesn't matter

# To define global variable,we declare it with keyword global
